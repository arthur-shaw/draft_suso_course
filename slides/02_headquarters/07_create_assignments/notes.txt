## On paper

Need a few images:

- Cover page, without annotations
- Cover page with annotations to identify identifying variables

## In Interviewer

- List of cases. Image showing list of cases in `Create New` tab
- Details for each case. Video showing how details shown (hidden) when card tapped to expand (collapse) details.
- Details to identify a case. Show two processes for finding a case:
    - Manual tap to expand
    - Search, which demonstrably operates across tabs (with target case in `Started`) tab

## Designer

- In Survey Solutions > User provides IDs. Show cover page in Designer.

## Headquarters

- One-by-one. Short video showing the process of creating an assignment one-by-one. Could be same as in "whole game" slides. See intent [here](02_headquarters/07_create_assignments/create_assignments.html#/one-by-one). Maybe edit down the content from `server overview create assignments.mp4`.
- Batch. Short video of process for creating and uploading assignments in bulk. See intent [here](02_headquarters/07_create_assignments/create_assignments.html#/batch).

## In practice

See the videos on these slides:

- Obtain the list of ID variables
- Compare inputs with desired outputs
- Modify inputs
- Export tab-delimited outputs
